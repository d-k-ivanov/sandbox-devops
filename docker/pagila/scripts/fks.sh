# One way to look at a database's structure is as a graph of foreign key relationships among tables.
# Two styles of visual representation predominate: models or entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) created
# as part of requirements negotiation and design, and descriptive diagrams of an extant database.
# The former are drawn by hand on a whiteboard or in diagramming software; the latter are often generated
# by database management tools with some manual cleanup and organization. Both styles usually take the
# complete database as their object, and whether descriptive or prescriptive, their role in the software
# development process is as reference material, or documentation.
